# Sonoff Basic Mozilla WebThing implementation

This is a by no means complete implementation for the Sonoff basic. *This is intended to be a proof of concept and should be handled as such!*

## Making it work

To get this library to compile properly, you'll need to rename the `src/user_config.h.example` to `src/user_config.h` and fill in the details in that file.

## Features

- [ ] On/Off State representation
- [ ] Toggling the On/Off state via API
- [ ] Toggling the On/Off state via Button
- [ ] Green Light when connected to the network
